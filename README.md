## Setting Up Your Python Virtual Environment
To setup your python virtual environment run the following command
```
make build_pyDist
```
This command will run the makefile from pyDist which will setup
a virtual environment in a new dirctory called pyDist. You can 
activate the virtual environment using 
```
source pyDist/distEnv/bin/activate
```
and you can deactivate it using
```
deactivate
```
This virtual environment is not added to your commits.
